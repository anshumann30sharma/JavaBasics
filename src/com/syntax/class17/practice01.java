Please create methods with different access modifiers (one for each access modifier)

In each method write the logic accordingly like 
for private method write the logic in the println Statement 
as "This is Private Method" accordingly for rest of the methods
 that have different access modifiers should be a total of 4 outputs,

This is Default Method
This is Protected Method
This is Public Method

In AnotherClass declare a private, default, protected, public methods and
 have them each return the name of the what access modifier they are using.
